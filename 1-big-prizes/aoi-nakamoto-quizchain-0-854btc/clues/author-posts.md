The question for this stage links to Hal Finney's "Bitcoin and me" post on
bitcointalk (topic 155054). Stage 1's escrow, `19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN`,
was solved and swept on 2019-08-03; its answer is not part of the live prize and
is used in this folder only as a mechanism reference (see README).

## Quizchain2 Block 76, 2019-07-22

https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/cgcv9i/77_mbtc_quizchain2_block_76/

> "Question: change to"
> "Format: [solution] TOMI [TOMI]"
> "First three digits of MD5 hash are f8e (copypasted)."

Update, same thread: "First two digits of solution only are 1d."

Update, same thread: "Hint 1. Change question from \"change to\" to \"from change
to\"."

## Real Big Block Discussion thread

https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/chn8un/real_big_block_discussion/

2019-07-25: "When I posted the real big block at the Wattpad site, I added extra
line breaks between paragraphs. This information is needed to solve the block."

2019-07-28: "I have line breaks in the chapter between all paragraphs. And there
are two line breaks there now, since Wattpad would not display them correctly
with only one each. [...] The solution you need to hash with has only one line
break between paragraphs."

2019-07-31: "I took back the prize for a moment and sent it again to a new
address, hashing with a slightly different solution [...] It has multiple
paragraphs and two line breaks between each of them."

Same thread, immediately after the 2019-07-31 post, a reader (martypyouknowme)
asks her to disambiguate "two line breaks" as either one keystroke-Enter
between paragraphs or two. Her reply: "I mean the second one. Hit enter twice.
This displays in Ascii as 13 10 13 10, according to asciivalue.com." That is
`\r\n\r\n` (CRLF CRLF), not `\n\n` (LF LF). This is a precise, primary-source
confirmation, but it sits in tension with the 2019-07-28 quote just above,
which says the string she actually hashes has only one line break between
paragraphs even though the chapter is typed and displayed with two. Read
together, the most consistent explanation is that the difference between the
superseded solution and this current one is exactly this: the earlier hash
used one line break between paragraphs, the rehash confirmed by this exchange
uses two (`\r\n\r\n`). Every whole-chapter and whole-section candidate has now
been tested under both interpretations (see `analysis/tested.md`); 0 match
either way, so this remains unresolved rather than confirmed.

She also mentions, in an aside earlier in the same thread: "I just noticed
that the 7th private key in the list for this wallet contains the number 7
three times [...] the first one also has some amazing properties," which is
why `tools/oracle.py` now checks derivation indices 0 through 19 rather than
0 through 5: she was looking at more than 6 derived addresses for at least one
block in this series, so the oracle should too.

This last post corresponds to the current, still-funded escrow
(`14zMkTgaVXJcxdh4JdWi29MLRR44iUSG9W`, funded 2019-07-30); an earlier address,
`1EFojcAo2vbhRGCGCa7q8Wwvzss28mhQYC`, was funded 2019-07-24 from the
before-the-rehash solution and holds no funds today.

## The Wattpad chapter

https://www.wattpad.com/720888559-second

The author's own published chapter, titled "Second", posted under her own
Wattpad account. Its text is the confirmed source of Real Big Block stage 2's
answer (see README). This folder does not reproduce the chapter text.
