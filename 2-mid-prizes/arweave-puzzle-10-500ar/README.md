# Arweave Puzzle #10 (500.02225493 AR, [OPEN])

Tiamat (@ArweaveP) published this puzzle on the Arweave permaweb on 2020-04-14: a single
torn-paper image showing 5 drawn keys (two dice, a handwritten "6 3 18", a silhouette
inside the Arweave logo's "a", the bracket notation "[0-19]", and a physical key tagged
"...nesis #28"), feeding one free-text field into the same client-side decrypt routine
used across this author's series. I reversed and certified the decrypt pipeline against a
solved sibling puzzle, but the author never published any length or charset constraint
for this puzzle specifically, unlike most of its siblings. Reading the 5 keys against the
answer grammar of 3 other solved puzzles in the series, I have tested on the order of 8
million literal, pun, and genesis-block candidate readings with 0 matches, plus 10 direct
transcriptions of Genesis 28's actual text tested 2026-08-16 (the full chapter, and the 2
most literal readings of the "[0-19]" bracket and "6 3 18" notation), also negative. What
remains is the specific token-selection rule the author actually used, not the passage
identification itself.

## The puzzle as published

The live page (still up) shows one torn-paper drawing and a single free-text input field
with a button that submits the typed string to the decrypt routine; no `maxlength`, no
case-folding, no separator hint. The full
403-tweet @ArweaveP archive (2019-05-23 to 2022-10-15) contains exactly 3 length or
charset statements in total, and none of them is about puzzle #10 (2 are about puzzle #7,
one about puzzle #12). 3 users asked the length question directly under the #10
announcement and the author answered none of them; his only reply under that tweet is a
status line,
["1,2,4,8 = solved / 3,5,7,9 = not solved yet"](https://twitter.com/arweavep/status/1250036746802298885)
(2020-04-14). In a reply on the #10 thread on 2020-04-22, the confirmed solver of a later
puzzle in the series, @_LeFevre_, read the image as a reference to the Arweave genesis
block and a 2018 Palpatine meme, adding that the puzzle was "too vague to know what you
are actually supposed to be solving."

## What is understood

### Mechanism

The page reads the single free-text field verbatim (no trimming, no case-folding),
stretches it with SHA-512 applied 11,513 times, and uses the resulting 128-character hex
digest as an EvpKDF/AES-OpenSSL password to decrypt an embedded ciphertext. Success is
declared only if the plaintext contains the literal marker `"kty":"RSA"`. This is the
same CryptoJS bundle, including the same non-standard 1024-bit-key, 38-round Rijndael
quirk (crypto-js issue #293), used across this author's series. The visible `size="24"`
attribute on the input field is cosmetic, not the true answer length: sibling puzzle #7
uses `size="20"` but its real answer is 57 characters.

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest       # reproduces the solved sibling Arweave #8
python3 tools/oracle.py "CandidateAnswerString"
python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin          # one candidate per line
```

A candidate is passed through exactly as typed (case-sensitive, no trimming).
`MATCH <address>` on a hit, `NO MATCH` otherwise. Since no dependency available to this
repository implements CryptoJS's non-standard Rijndael variant, the oracle reimplements
it in pure Python; the implementation was checked to reproduce a standard AES-256 library
exactly at the standard key size before being trusted at this puzzle's non-standard one.

### Certified against

`tools/oracle.py --selftest` decrypts the real ciphertext of the solved sibling Arweave
Puzzle Weave #8 with its published answer, `RasputinWilhelmAlekhine`, and recovers a JWK
whose derived address matches `ayJQH1S6Fi52OEokLVi2tl5kr_y39LSfhJcNV0z9Ny4` exactly, the
address baked into that puzzle's own success page. Puzzle #8's escrow is already spent
(checked 2026-08-16), so this is historical calibration data, not a live prize. The
oracle's raw decrypt output was also checked byte-for-byte against this puzzle's own
JavaScript decryptor running under Node, on both matching and non-matching passphrases.

### Established facts

1. The escrow is funded and unspent: 500.02225493 AR, checked via
   `arweave.net/wallet/<address>/balance` on 2026-08-16.
2. No author statement about #10's answer length or charset exists anywhere in the
   403-tweet archive or the reply thread under the announcement.
3. 6 solved siblings across the series (3 decrypted locally: #5, #7, #8; 3 more reported
   by community research: #1, #2, #4) share one answer grammar: tokens concatenated with
   no separators, Capitalized proper nouns, plain digits for numbers, in-image
   punctuation allowed, total length ranging from 23 to 58 characters.
4. The Arweave genesis block's transaction index 28 decodes to the literal text "test";
   the community's own reversed display numbering instead maps its position 286 to "We'll
   see what happens." Both readings were checked and both fail.
5. No steganographic payload was found in the puzzle image (exiftool, binwalk,
   `zsteg -a` all negative).

Cumulative: on the order of 8,010,190 candidates tested to completion, 0 matches. 2 more
candidate sets (about 2,450,000 combined) were generated but not run to exhaustion and are
not counted here as negatives.

10 direct readings of Genesis 28's actual KJV text (sourced 2026-08-16 from a public-domain
KJV JSON dataset, not transcribed from memory, since a single wrong word would silently
fail every hash) were tested 2026-08-16: the full chapter with and without punctuation and
spaces; verses 1-19 only (matching the "[0-19]" bracket clue); verses 6, 3 and 18
concatenated in that order and verses 3 through 18 as a range (both readings of the
handwritten "6 3 18" clue); and verse 12 alone (the ladder verse itself), with and without
punctuation. 0 matches. This was the specific gap the open lead below called the most
promising untested reading; it is no longer untested, though the underlying hypothesis
(some reading of Genesis 28 is the answer) is not itself ruled out, only these 10 direct
transcriptions of it.

## Open leads, ranked

1. **The exact wording of Bible Genesis chapter 28** (hours; 10 direct readings tested
   2026-08-16, 0 matches, see above). The Jacob's Ladder / Bethel passage, transcribed as
   a long word-series the way solved sibling #7's 57-character answer is built. The 10
   most direct transcriptions (full chapter, the 2 bracket/notation-guided verse subsets,
   the ladder verse alone) are now tested; what remains is the specific token-selection
   and concatenation rule sibling #7 actually used, which is not documented in this folder
   and was not reverse-engineered here. Confirmed by a candidate matching the escrow
   exactly; killed by exhausting every reasonable transcription of the passage.
2. **Non-public channels** (needs a person): the author's Telegram group, a later Discord,
   or a direct reply, none of which have produced a #10-specific hint in the public
   record searched so far. A community-notes author's contact email surfaced during this
   research is not the puzzle author and should not be treated as an official channel.
