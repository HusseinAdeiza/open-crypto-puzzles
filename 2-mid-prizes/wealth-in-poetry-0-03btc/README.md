# Trithemius: Wealth in Poetry (0.0312463 BTC, [OPEN])

Writing under the pseudonym "Trithemius," the author published an article on Medium/Coinmonks in
2019 titled "Securing Bitcoin Seed Phrases in Stories," teaching a method for hiding a 12-word
BIP39 seed inside an ordinary narrative: a numeric key, specific to the author, picks word
positions out of the story text. The article demonstrates the method with two fully worked
examples and closes by stating that the reader has, by finishing the article, read every word
needed to recover a wallet holding 0.03 BTC. I calibrated the only certain part of the mechanism,
the tokenization rule, against both worked examples, then ran roughly 900,000 derivations across
three large campaigns covering numeric keys, derivation families, and passphrases. All are
negative. The escrow remains unclaimed seven years on, and the real carrier text and numeric key,
by the author's own design, are not guessable from the article alone.

## The puzzle as published

The article (archived locally, byte-identical to a third-party mirror,
[medium.com/coinmonks](https://medium.com/coinmonks/securing-bitcoin-seed-phrases-in-stories-d8eb43a02254),
2019-02-11) opens with a story about the author's grandfather smuggling gold while fleeing China,
then teaches "trithemian seeds." It demonstrates two encoding methods, each with its own story and
seed: a phone number whose digits give word positions in a courtship story, and a formula
`position[i] = i*10 + digit[i]` applied to the concatenated digits of a location's latitude and
longitude, run against a story about a letter to a court. The article closes: "The beauty of
trithemian seeds is that they hide in plain sight. If you've read this far, you've read every
word required to access a wallet with .03 BTC. Good luck!" and "Only you know which story
contains your wealth."

## What is understood

### Mechanism

The chain is: article text, tokenized into words, then a numeric key (unknown, author-specific)
selects 12 word positions, giving a candidate 12-word phrase to run through BIP39 and every
standard derivation path. Tokenization is the one calibrated link: of 4 tokenizers tried, exactly
2 reproduce the word positions of both published worked examples exactly, which is why those two
are treated as certain rather than assumed.

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest              # must print SELFTEST OK
python3 tools/oracle.py "w1 w2 ... w12"
python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin                  # one 12-word candidate per line
```

A candidate is checked the same way a solver would: derive the P2PKH address (compressed and
uncompressed) for a 12-word candidate under BIP44/BIP49 (3 accounts, both change branches, 5
indexes each), 5 raw BIP32 paths seen used elsewhere in this puzzle series, the master key
with no derivation, old-Electrum v1, and old-Electrum v2 (standard, non-segwit), and compare
each, byte for byte, to the escrow address. This folder previously shipped no oracle at all
(built 2026-08-16, closing the gap named in `analysis/leads.md`); the roughly 900,000
derivations reported under "What has been tested" below predate it and were produced by
private, uncertified code, which is why every row there is marked uncertified.

### Established facts

1. Tokenization is calibrated: 2 of 4 tested tokenizers reproduce the exact word positions of
   both of the author's published examples.
2. The article's own GPS-formula example, applied to the full narrative rather than just the
   demonstration letter, leaves 2 of the 12 word slots with zero valid BIP39 options, which
   confirms that published example is a worked demonstration, not the real wallet key.
3. A stylometric pass (surprisal and substitution scoring across the full narrative) found BIP39
   words statistically indistinguishable from the rest of the text, meaning there is no detectable
   insertion fingerprint marking which words are the real seed.
4. Forensic analysis of the archived article file (33 MIME parts, every embedded image at full
   resolution) found no appended data, no hidden metadata, and no zero-width characters.

## What has been tested

Full ledger in [analysis/tested.md](analysis/tested.md). Every negative below is marked
uncertified: no known-good acceptance vector has been built for the derivation code, so under
this repository's own convention these counts describe search coverage, not proven exhaustion.

| Hypothesis | Space | Method | Result | Witness | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Numeric-key enumeration: coordinate formats, landmarks, in-article numbers, phone/GPS/cumulative methods, multiple carriers | 541 keys, about 300,000 derivations | address comparison, compressed and uncompressed | 0 match | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |
| Derivation-family sweep on the 4 clean example seeds: BIP44/49/84 multi-account, raw BIP32 paths, master key, old Electrum v1/v2 | about 500,000 addresses derived | address comparison | 0 match | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |
| Passphrase (25th word) sweep on the 4 clean seeds: curated article-derived terms, full-phrase candidates, brute-force wordlists | about 78,000 derivations | address comparison | 0 match | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |
| Image steganography: full-resolution originals, LSB analysis on lossless formats | 11 images | bit-plane analysis | pure noise (bit ratio about 0.5), 0 WIF or hex64 strings recovered | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |
| Direct WIF/hex scan of the raw article file | 125 base58-like substrings | BIP38/WIF checksum check | 0 pass the checksum (all image data false positives) | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |

## Open leads, ranked

1. **Read the cipher table on the embedded Steganographia title-page photo** (hours). The article
   embeds a high-resolution photo of the title page of Trithemius's own historical book
   Steganographia, shelfmark Jesus College M.7.7, which contains genuine cipher tables. The
   author published this image without flagging it as a candidate key; it is the one artifact in
   the article not yet exploited as a possible numeric key source.
2. **Rule out an old-Electrum (non-BIP39) wallet** (hours; oracle now supports it). The
   derivation code exists and is certified as of 2026-08-16 (see above); what remains is
   running the existing candidate word sets through the old-Electrum v1 and v2 branches, which
   has not been done, only proposed.

Closed: building a certified acceptance test for the derivation code. `tools/oracle.py` is now
shipped and certified against 5 independent vectors (see "Derivation and oracle" above), 2 of
them cross-checked against Electrum's own real source code. Every future negative through this
file is a real one, not an uncertified one; the roughly 900,000 candidates tested before
2026-08-16 remain uncertified, since they used different, unshipped code.
